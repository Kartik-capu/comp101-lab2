Lab 2 Question: 

You have created a GitHub repository and want to share it with your friend Bob by 
sending him the repository link. When Bob clicks the link in his web browser, some 
communication happens over the internet. Explain step by step what happens using the 
concepts of client and server. In your explanation, make sure to mention:

• Which device acts as the client
• Which device acts as the server
• How Bob’s browser requests the repository content
• How the server responds and sends the content back to Bob

1. Bob's device acts as the client.
2. My device acts as the server.
3. The link which I have created by making my GitHub respiratory requires requests access from the client's device which is Bob's device.
4. The server will immediately responds, just after the Bob will click the link which I have shared with Bob and all the content created on my device will be visible to Bob.
